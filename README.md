# Battleship
Battleship Game
This is my first try using git and github. I don't really know what am I doing and how to use both of this but I'm trying my best to learn
using git and github properly.

The code i am doing right now is some simple battleship game. The user will need to enter a number between 0-6 to sink a ship. If the user
enter a correct number it will sink the ship and if the user enter a wrong number it will ask for another number until the user sink the
battleship.
